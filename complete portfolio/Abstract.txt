Abstract

The integrity of elections is a cornerstone of democracy, yet traditional voting systems face significant challenges, including vote rigging, manipulation, and lack of transparency. These issues have eroded public trust in electoral processes worldwide. To address these challenges, this project explores the implementation of an e-voting system using blockchain technology, leveraging its decentralized, secure, and transparent nature.

Blockchain technology ensures data immutability, verifiability, and privacy, making it a promising solution for secure voting systems. By integrating smart contracts, blockchain enables automated, tamper-proof processes, eliminating risks such as duplicate voting and unauthorized access. Ethereum, a leading blockchain platform, is utilized in this project due to its robust support for smart contracts and widespread adoption.

The proposed e-voting system is developed using the Solidity programming language and tested on the Ethereum network. It offers key features such as:

Security: Preventing vote duplication and ensuring tamper-proof data.
Transparency: Allowing all stakeholders to verify the voting process.
Privacy: Protecting voter identities while maintaining the integrity of votes.
This system provides a cost-effective, scalable, and user-friendly solution for conducting elections. By adopting blockchain-based e-voting, governments and organizations can enhance trust, efficiency, and accessibility in the democratic process, paving the way for a more secure and transparent electoral future.
